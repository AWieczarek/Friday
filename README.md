This is 2D game about drinking beer with firends created in Unity. Your goal is to drink all beers and don't get caught by your parents. It's seem to be a clicker with level system.

This game was suposed to be a small project before matura exam. Lack of time and lack of ideas to develeop it lead me to abandon this project. 

# ToDo
- shop with new items and multipliers
- adverts
- better "parents" system
